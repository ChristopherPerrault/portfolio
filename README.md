Built as a way for me to dive into Next.js 14 and Vercel for the first time. I opted to try and use Next.js's App Router over the older Pages system because not only was it recommended (and I'd like to stay as "current" as possible) but also to challenge myself. I used only _some_ AI assistance when building my portfolio site, and with Next 14 being so recent, I had to rely strictly on the documentation or fresh issues to draw solutions from. Very exciting.

I hope you enjoy it!
